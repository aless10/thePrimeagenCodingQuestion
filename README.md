## The Primeagen's Favourite Coding Question

This exercise was inspired by https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w84-FPJa4_g&ab_channel=TomDoesTech who codes the solution for the favourite coding challenge by https://github.com/ThePrimeagen

### The coding question

You have a queue, it returns a promise and you have to hand it a promise factory. When they call the promise factory, your job gets to execute the async request. You can have up to three running tasks at any one time.


### Why I wanted to solve it?

- I like solving coding challenges
- I'm not so good with promises and async
- After looking at the video, I remembered an interview where I was asked this question (kind of) and I completely bombed it
